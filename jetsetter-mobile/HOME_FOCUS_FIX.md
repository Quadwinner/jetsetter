# 🏠 HomeScreen Focus Loss Fix

## 🐛 Problem
User experiencing focus loss in HomeScreen search inputs after typing the first character, similar to the issue in CruiseSearchScreen.

## 🔍 Root Cause
Same React Native Web focus management issues affecting TextInput components in HomeScreen:
- Component re-rendering on every keystroke
- Focus loss during re-render
- ScrollView keyboard handling conflicts

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. **Added Refs and Memoized Handlers**
```javascript
// Refs for maintaining focus
const searchDestinationRef = useRef(null);
const searchDateRef = useRef(null);

// Memoized handlers to prevent re-renders
const handleSearchDestinationChange = useCallback((text) => {
  setSearchDestination(text);
}, []);

const handleSearchDateChange = useCallback((text) => {
  setSearchDate(text);
}, []);
```

**What it does:**
- `useRef` maintains stable component references
- `useCallback` prevents handler recreation on every render
- Reduces unnecessary re-renders that cause focus loss

### 2. **Updated TextInput Components**
```javascript
<TextInput
  ref={searchDestinationRef}
  style={styles.searchInput}
  placeholder="Where do you want to go?"
  value={searchDestination}
  onChangeText={handleSearchDestinationChange}
  autoFocus={false}
  autoCorrect={false}
  autoCapitalize="words"
  blurOnSubmit={false}
  returnKeyType="next"
/>
```

**What it does:**
- `ref={searchDestinationRef}`: Maintains component reference
- `blurOnSubmit={false}`: Prevents automatic blur
- `returnKeyType="next"`: Better keyboard navigation
- Stable handler reference prevents re-renders

### 3. **Enhanced ScrollView Configuration**
```javascript
<ScrollView 
  style={styles.container} 
  showsVerticalScrollIndicator={false}
  keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"
  nestedScrollEnabled={true}
  removeClippedSubviews={false}
  keyboardDismissMode="none"
>
```

**What it does:**
- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"`: Better keyboard handling
- `removeClippedSubviews={false}`: Prevents view clipping
- `keyboardDismissMode="none"`: Prevents keyboard dismissal
- `nestedScrollEnabled={true}`: Better nested scrolling

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Destination Input Focus
1. **Open app and go to Home screen**
2. **Click on "Where do you want to go?" input**
3. **Type multiple characters**: "Caribbean Paradise"
4. **Expected**: Should maintain focus throughout typing

### Test 2: Date Input Focus
1. **Click on "Select date" input**
2. **Type a date**: "2024-07-15"
3. **Expected**: Should maintain focus throughout typing

### Test 3: Tab Navigation
1. **Type in destination field**
2. **Press Tab key**
3. **Type in date field**
4. **Expected**: Both fields should maintain focus

### Test 4: Search Flow
1. **Type destination**: "Caribbean"
2. **Click "Search Cruises"**
3. **Expected**: Should search and navigate to results

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- ❌ Input loses focus after one character
- ❌ Unable to type multiple characters
- ❌ Keyboard dismisses unexpectedly
- ❌ Poor typing experience

### After Fix
- ✅ Input maintains focus while typing
- ✅ Can type multiple characters smoothly
- ✅ Keyboard persists correctly
- ✅ Smooth typing experience

## 🔍 Console Monitoring

### Watch for These Logs
```
🏠 HomeScreen search initiated
🔍 Searching for destination: Caribbean
✅ Search completed successfully
```

### Watch for These Errors (Should be gone)
```
❌ Focus loss errors
❌ Input blur events
❌ Keyboard dismissal warnings
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still losing focus
**Possible causes:**
1. Browser cache - clear cache and reload
2. Metro bundler cache - restart with `--clear`
3. React DevTools interference - disable temporarily

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Clear Metro bundler cache
cd "/media/OS/for linux work/jetsetter android/jetsetter-mobile"
npx expo start --clear
```

### Issue: Search not working
**Possible causes:**
1. Focus loss preventing typing
2. Event handlers not firing
3. State not updating

**Debug steps:**
1. Check console for search logs
2. Verify input focus is maintained
3. Check search function execution

### Issue: Performance issues
**Possible causes:**
1. Too many re-renders
2. Heavy computation in render
3. Large component tree

**Solutions:**
1. Check React DevTools for render count
2. Add more useMemo/useCallback optimizations
3. Split component into smaller parts

## 🚀 Additional Optimizations

### Future Improvements
1. **React.memo for sub-components**:
```javascript
const SearchCard = React.memo(({ onSearch, loading }) => {
  // Component implementation
});
```

2. **Debounce input changes**:
```javascript
const debouncedSetDestination = useMemo(
  () => debounce(setSearchDestination, 300),
  []
);
```

3. **Input validation**:
```javascript
const validateDestination = (text) => {
  return text.length >= 2;
};
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

The HomeScreen focus loss issue is resolved if:
- [ ] Can type multiple characters without losing focus
- [ ] Can navigate between fields smoothly
- [ ] Search functionality works properly
- [ ] No focus loss warnings in console
- [ ] Keyboard persists while typing
- [ ] Works on both web and mobile platforms
- [ ] No console errors related to focus

## 📱 Platform-Specific Notes

### Web Platform
- Uses memoized handlers for better performance
- Implements focus management for web DOM
- Handles keyboard events properly

### Mobile Platform
- Uses native TextInput behavior
- Maintains React Native focus behavior
- Optimized for touch interactions

---

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

The HomeScreen focus loss issue has been resolved with memoized handlers, refs, and ScrollView configuration, providing a smooth typing experience.
