# 🏠 Home Search Fix - Direct Navigation to Results

## 🐛 Problem
User was getting confused because clicking the search button on the home page was taking them to the CruiseSearchScreen (with test navigation button) instead of directly showing cruise results.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `handleSearch` function in HomeScreen was navigating to `CruiseSearch` screen instead of performing the search and going directly to `CruiseResults`.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. **Updated HomeScreen Search Logic**
```javascript
const handleSearch = async () => {
  if (searchDestination.trim()) {
    setSearchLoading(true);
    try {
      // Import cruise service
      const cruiseService = require('../services/cruiseService').default;
      
      // Search for cruises with the destination
      const result = await cruiseService.searchCruises({
        destination: searchDestination.trim(),
        passengers: 2
      });
      
      if (result.success && result.cruises.length > 0) {
        // Navigate directly to results with search data
        navigation.navigate('CruiseResults', {
          cruises: result.cruises,
          searchParams: { destination: searchDestination.trim(), passengers: 2 }
        });
      } else {
        Alert.alert('No Results', 'No cruises found for that destination. Please try a different search.');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Search error:', error);
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Unable to search cruises. Please try again.');
    } finally {
      setSearchLoading(false);
    }
  } else {
    Alert.alert('Search', 'Please enter a destination to search for cruises');
  }
};
```

**What it does:**
- Performs actual cruise search using the cruise service
- Navigates directly to `CruiseResults` with search data
- Shows loading state during search
- Handles errors gracefully
- Shows appropriate alerts for no results

### 2. **Added Loading State**
```javascript
const [searchLoading, setSearchLoading] = useState(false);

// In the search button
<TouchableOpacity 
  style={[styles.searchButton, searchLoading && styles.searchButtonDisabled]} 
  onPress={handleSearch}
  disabled={searchLoading}
>
  {searchLoading ? (
    <>
      <ActivityIndicator size="small" color="#fff" />
      <Text style={styles.searchButtonText}>Searching...</Text>
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      <Ionicons name="search" size={20} color="#fff" />
      <Text style={styles.searchButtonText}>Search Cruises</Text>
    </>
  )}
</TouchableOpacity>
```

**What it does:**
- Shows loading spinner and "Searching..." text during search
- Disables button to prevent multiple searches
- Provides visual feedback to user

### 3. **Removed Test Navigation Button**
Removed the confusing "🧪 Test Navigation" button from CruiseSearchScreen since it's no longer needed for normal user flow.

### 4. **Added Disabled Button Style**
```javascript
searchButtonDisabled: {
  backgroundColor: '#94A3B8',
  shadowOpacity: 0.1,
},
```

**What it does:**
- Provides visual indication when button is disabled
- Uses muted colors to show inactive state

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
