## üîê Important Notes

### Backend Requirements
‚ö†Ô∏è **The backend must be running with the following endpoints:**
- `POST /api/flights/search`
- `POST /api/flights/price`
- `POST /api/flights/order`

If the backend at `https://prod-six-phi.vercel.app/api` doesn't have these endpoints yet, you'll need to:
1. Deploy the backend with Amadeus integration
2. Or update `API_CONFIG.BASE_URL` in `src/constants/config.js` to point to your backend

### Date Format
- **Search dates:** Any format (YYYY-MM-DD recommended)
- **Traveler DOB:** Must be YYYY-MM-DD format

### Gender Values
- Must be exactly: `MALE` or `FEMALE` (case-insensitive)

### IATA Codes
- Extracted automatically from airport strings like "New Delhi (DEL)"
- Format: City Name (XXX) where XXX is 3-letter code

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. ARC Pay Integration
Currently, payment goes directly to booking. To add real payment:
- Add ARC Pay SDK/API calls in `FlightPaymentScreen.js`
- Show payment form before booking
- Pass payment confirmation to booking API

### 2. Supabase Persistence
To save bookings to database:
- Add `saveBooking()` call after successful booking
- Store in Supabase `bookings` table
- Display in My Trips screen

### 3. Date Picker
Replace text input with proper date picker:
```bash
expo install @react-native-community/datetimepicker
```

### 4. Calendar View
Add calendar for date selection:
```bash
npm install react-native-calendars
```

### 5. Price Alerts
Add price tracking and notifications for routes

### 6. Seat Selection
Integrate seat map selection in payment flow
